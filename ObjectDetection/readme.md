[Custom vision service](https://www.customvision.ai) can also be used for Object Detection.

Object detection is used to determine if a particular object exists in a photo and where it is located within the photo.

The zip files above contain images you can use to train and test a Custom vision service model to detect runners and their race bibs using the [instructions in this post](https://hockeygeekgirl.com/2019/06/03/object-detection-with-custom-vision-service/) to try it yourself using the training images provided 

If you prefer to use the Custom Vision Service tool using code instead of the graphical interface, check out the [Create an object detection model project with the Custom Vision .NET SDK Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/python-tutorial-od)

If you want to create the model using the graphical interface and then call the model using your code, check out the [tutorial on detecting Azure logos for a mobile app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/logo-detector-mobile)
