# Training your own model
[Computer vision API](https://github.com/hockeygeekgirl/CustomVisionServiceFun/tree/master/Computer%20Vision%20API)s do not always recognize objects and patterns you want to identify.

The [Custom vision service](https://github.com/hockeygeekgirl/CustomVisionServiceFun/tree/master/Custom%20Vision%20Service) can be trained to recognize new objects but may not catch the subtleties you need to detect.

Sometimes you need to train your own model. This requires a higher level of skill and knowledge. Fortunately there are a lot of free resources you can leverage to develop these skills.

Here are some recommended tutorials and resources to help you master the basics and explore some of the tools and libraries required for training your own model to analyze images.

[AI School](https://aischool.microsoft.com) - Provides a number of learning paths and resources to learn AI. Those learning modules include content on machine learning.
