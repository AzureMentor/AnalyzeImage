# Training your own model
Computer vision APIs do not always recognize objects and patterns you want to identify
The Custom vision service can be trained to recognize new objects but may not be meet your needs
Sometimes you need to train your own model.

Training your model requires a higher level of skill and knowledge.

Here are some recommended tutorials and resources to help you master the basics and explore some of the toosl and libraries required for training your own model to analyze images.
